# ESP32 FreeRTOS CLI

This is a Command Line Interface for the ESP32 using the ESP32 multicore port of FreeRTOS.
This project started in the [`ADolbyB/rtos-esp32-examples`](https://github.com/ADolbyB/rtos-esp32-examples) 
repository as `04-LED-CLI`, but it took on a life of its own and it turned into this project.

Currently, the CLI can perform the following on the ESP32 Thing Plus C from SparkFun.
 - 4 functions to control the RGB LED connected to `GPIO_2`.
 - 2 functions to control the Blue LED connected to `GPIO_13`.
 - [In Progress] The on-board SD Card Slot connected to `GPIO_5`.
     - Test Code: [SD_Test](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Thing_Plus_ESP32_WROOM_C/blob/main/Firmware/Test%20Sketches/SD_Test/SD_Test.ino)
 - [In Progress] The on-board MAX17048 $I^2C$ LiPo Battery Fuel Guage.
     - Test Code: [MAX17048_FuelGuage](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Thing_Plus_ESP32_WROOM_C/blob/main/Firmware/Test%20Sketches/MAX17048_FuelGauge/MAX17048_FuelGauge.ino)

This is a work in progress.
